before attaining form which reached us various mental influences work during its composition its title patron changed some unknown reason finally dedicated lorenzo de medici although machiavelli discussed casavecchio whether should sent presented person patron there no evidence lorenzo ever received even read certainly never gave machiavelli any employment although plagiarized during

freedom acquired either arms prince himself others else fortune ability concerning hereditary principalities leave all discussion republics inasmuch another place written length address myself only principalities doing keep order indicated above discuss how such principalities ruled preserved say once there fewer difficulties holding hereditary states those long accustomed family prince new ones sufficient only transgress customs his ancestors deal prudently circumstances arise prince average powers maintain himself his state unless deprived some extraordinary excessive force if should deprived whenever anything sinister happens usurper regain italy example duke ferrara who withstood attacks venetians 84 nor those pope julius 10 unless been long established his dominions hereditary prince less cause less necessity offend hence happens more loved unless extraordinary vices cause hated reasonable expect his subjects naturally well disposed towards antiquity duration his rule memories motives make change lost one change always leaves toothing another concerning mixed principalities difficulties occur new principality firstly if entirely new member state which taken collectively may called composite changes arise chiefly inherent difficulty which there all new principalities men change rulers willingly hoping better themselves hope induces take arms against who rules wherein deceived because afterwards find experience gone bad worse follows also another natural common necessity which always causes new prince burden those who submitted his soldiery infinite other hardships which must put upon his new acquisition way enemies all those whom injured seizing principality able keep those friends who put there because being able satisfy way expected cannot take strong measures against feeling bound although one may very strong armed forces yet entering province one always need goodwill natives these reasons louis twelfth king france quickly occupied milan quickly lost turn first time only needed lodovico s own forces because those who opened gates finding themselves deceived hopes future benefit endure ill treatment new prince very true after acquiring rebellious provinces second time lightly lost afterwards because prince little reluctance takes opportunity rebellion punish delinquents clear suspects strengthen himself weakest places thus cause france lose milan first time enough duke lodovico 1 raise insurrections borders cause lose second time necessary bring whole world against his armies should defeated driven italy which followed causes above mentioned 1 duke lodovico lodovico moro son francesco sforza who married beatrice d este ruled milan 1494 1500 died 1510 nevertheless milan taken france both first second time general reasons first been discussed remains name those second see what resources what any one his situation maintaining himself more securely his acquisition king france now say those dominions which when acquired added ancient state who acquires either same country language when easier hold especially when been accustomed self government hold securely enough destroyed family prince who ruling because two peoples preserving other things old conditions being unlike customs live quietly together one seen brittany burgundy gascony normandy which been bound france long time although there may some difference language nevertheless customs alike people easily able get amongst themselves who annexed if wishes hold only bear mind two considerations one family former lord extinguished other neither laws nor taxes altered very short time become entirely one body old principality when states acquired country differing language customs laws there difficulties good fortune great energy needed hold one greatest most real helps who acquired should go reside there make his position more secure durable made turk greece who notwithstanding all other measures taken holding state if settled there been able keep because if one spot disorders seen spring one quickly remedy if one hand heard only when great one no longer remedy besides country pillaged officials subjects satisfied prompt recourse prince thus wishing good more cause love wishing otherwise fear who attack state outside must utmost caution long prince resides there only wrested greatest difficulty other better course send colonies one two places which may keys state necessary either else keep there great number cavalry infantry prince spend much colonies little no expense send keep there offends minority only citizens whom takes lands houses give new inhabitants those whom offends remaining poor scattered never able injure whilst rest being uninjured easily kept quiet same time anxious err fear should happen those who been despoiled conclusion say these colonies costly more faithful injure less injured been said being poor scattered cannot hurt upon one remark men ought either well treated crushed because avenge themselves lighter injuries more serious ones cannot therefore injury done man ought such kind one stand fear revenge maintaining armed men there place colonies one spends much more having consume garrison all income state acquisition turns loss many more exasperated because whole state injured through shifting garrison all become acquainted hardship all become hostile enemies who whilst beaten own ground yet able hurt every reason therefore such guards useless colony useful again prince who holds country differing above respects ought make himself head defender his less powerful neighbours weaken more powerful amongst taking care no foreigner powerful himself shall any accident get footing there always happen such one introduced those who discontented either through excess ambition through fear one seen already romans brought greece tolians every other country where obtained footing brought inhabitants usual course affairs soon powerful foreigner enters country all subject states drawn moved hatred which feel against ruling power respect those subject states take any trouble gain himself whole quickly rally state which acquired there only take care get hold too much power too much authority his own forces goodwill easily keep more powerful remain entirely master country who properly manage business soon lose what acquired whilst hold endless difficulties troubles romans countries which annexed observed closely these measures sent colonies maintained friendly relations 2 minor powers without increasing strength kept greater allow any strong foreign powers gain authority greece appears sufficient example achaeans tolians kept friendly kingdom macedonia humbled antiochus driven yet merits achaeans tolians never secured permission increase power nor persuasions philip ever induce romans his friends without first humbling nor influence antiochus make agree should retain any lordship country because romans these instances what all prudent princes ought who regard only present troubles also future ones which must prepare every energy because when foreseen easy remedy if wait until approach medicine no longer time because malady become incurable happens physicians say happens hectic fever beginning malady easy cure difficult detect course time having been either detected treated beginning becomes easy detect difficult cure thus happens affairs state when evils arise been foreseen which only given wise man see quickly redressed when through having been foreseen been permitted grow way every one see there no longer remedy therefore romans foreseeing troubles dealt once even avoid war let come head knew war avoided only put off advantage others moreover wished fight philip antiochus greece italy avoided both wish nor ever please which forever mouths wise ones time let us enjoy benefits time rather benefits own valour prudence time drives everything before able bring good well evil evil well good 2 see remark introduction word intrattenere let us turn france inquire whether done any things mentioned speak louis 3 charles 4 one whose conduct better observed having held possession italy longest period see done opposite those things which ought done retain state composed divers elements 3 louis king france father people born 1462 died 1515 4 charles king france born 1470 died 1498 king louis brought italy ambition venetians who desired obtain half state lombardy his intervention blame course taken king because wishing get foothold italy having no friends there seeing rather every door shut owing conduct charles forced accept those friendships which get succeeded very quickly his design if other matters made some mistakes king however having acquired lombardy regained once authority which charles lost genoa yielded florentines became his friends marquess mantua duke ferrara bentivogli lady forli lords faenza pesaro rimini camerino piombino lucchese pisans sienese everybody made advances become his friend venetians realize rashness course taken which order might secure two towns lombardy made king master two thirds italy let any one now consider what little difficulty king maintained his position italy observed rules above laid kept all his friends secure protected although numerous both weak timid some afraid church some venetians thus always been forced stand means easily made himself secure against those who remained powerful no sooner milan contrary assisting pope alexander occupy romagna never occurred action weakening himself depriving himself friends those who thrown themselves his lap whilst aggrandized church adding much temporal power spiritual thus giving greater authority having committed prime error obliged follow much put end ambition alexander prevent his becoming master tuscany himself forced come italy if enough aggrandized church deprived himself friends wishing kingdom naples divided king spain where prime arbiter italy takes associate ambitious country malcontents his own should somewhere shelter whereas left kingdom his own pensioner king drove put one there who able drive louis turn wish acquire truth very natural common men always when praised blamed when cannot yet wish any means there folly blame therefore if france attacked naples own forces ought done if ought divided if partition which made venetians lombardy justified excuse got foothold italy other partition merited blame excuse necessity therefore louis made these five errors destroyed minor powers increased strength one greater powers italy brought foreign power settle country send colonies which errors lived enough injure made sixth taking away dominions venetians because aggrandized church nor brought spain italy been very reasonable necessary humble having first taken these steps ought never consented ruin being powerful always kept off others designs lombardy which venetians never consented except become masters themselves there also because others wish take lombardy france order give venetians run counter both courage if any one should say king louis yielded romagna alexander kingdom spain avoid war answer reasons given above blunder ought never perpetrated avoid war because avoided only deferred disadvantage if another should allege pledge which king given pope assist enterprise exchange dissolution his marriage 5 cap rouen 6 reply what shall write later concerning faith princes how ought kept 5 louis divorced his wife jeanne daughter louis married 1499 anne brittany widow charles order retain duchy brittany crown 6 archbishop rouen georges d amboise created cardinal alexander born 1460 died 1510 thus king louis lost lombardy having followed any conditions observed those who taken possession countries wished retain nor there any miracle much reasonable quite natural these matters spoke nantes rouen when valentino cesare borgia son pope alexander usually called occupied romagna cardinal rouen observing italians understand war replied french understand statecraft meaning otherwise allowed church reach such greatness fact been seen greatness church spain italy been caused france ruin may attributed general rule drawn which never rarely fails who cause another becoming powerful ruined because predominancy been brought either astuteness else force both distrusted who been raised power why kingdom darius conquered alexander rebel against successors alexander his death considering difficulties which men hold newly acquired state some might wonder how seeing alexander great became master asia few years died whilst scarcely settled whence might appear reasonable whole empire rebelled nevertheless his successors maintained themselves meet no other difficulty which arose among themselves own ambitions answer principalities which one record found governed two different ways either prince body servants who assist govern kingdom ministers his favour permission prince barons who hold dignity antiquity blood grace prince such barons states own subjects who recognize lords hold natural affection those states governed prince his servants hold prince more consideration because all country there no one who recognized superior if yield obedience another minister official bear any particular affection examples these two governments time turk king france entire monarchy turk governed one lord others his servants dividing his kingdom sanjaks sends there different administrators shifts changes chooses king france placed midst ancient body lords acknowledged own subjects beloved own prerogatives nor king take these away except his peril therefore who considers both these states recognize great difficulties seizing state turk once conquered great ease holding causes difficulties seizing kingdom turk usurper cannot called princes kingdom nor hope assisted his designs revolt those whom lord around arises reasons given above his ministers being all slaves bondmen only corrupted great difficulty one expect little advantage when been corrupted cannot carry people reasons assigned hence who attacks turk must bear mind find united rely more his own strength revolt others if once turk been conquered routed field such way cannot replace his armies there nothing fear family prince being exterminated there remains no one fear others having no credit people conqueror rely before his victory ought fear after contrary happens kingdoms governed like france because one easily enter there gaining some baron kingdom one always finds malcontents such desire change such men reasons given open way state render victory easy if wish hold afterwards meet infinite difficulties both those who assisted those crushed nor enough exterminated family prince because lords remain make themselves heads fresh movements against unable either satisfy exterminate state lost whenever time brings opportunity now if consider what nature government darius find similar kingdom turk therefore only necessary alexander first overthrow field take country after which victory darius being killed state remained secure alexander above reasons if his successors been united enjoyed securely ease there no tumults raised kingdom except those provoked themselves impossible hold such tranquillity states constituted like france hence arose those frequent rebellions against romans spain france greece owing many principalities there these states which long memory endured romans always held insecure possession power long continuance empire memory passed away romans became secure possessors when fighting afterwards amongst themselves each one able attach himself his own parts country according authority assumed there family former lord being exterminated none other romans acknowledged when these things remembered no one marvel ease which alexander held empire asia difficulties which others keep acquisition such pyrrhus many more occasioned little abundance ability conqueror want uniformity subject state concerning way govern cities principalities which lived own laws before annexed whenever those states which been acquired stated been accustomed live own laws freedom there three courses those who wish hold first ruin next reside there person third permit live own laws drawing tribute establishing within oligarchy which keep friendly because such government being created prince knows cannot stand without his friendship interest its utmost support therefore who keep city accustomed freedom hold more easily means its own citizens any other way there example spartans romans spartans held athens thebes establishing there oligarchy nevertheless lost romans order hold capua carthage numantia dismantled lose wished hold greece spartans held making free permitting its laws succeed hold compelled dismantle many cities country truth there no safe way retain otherwise ruining who becomes master city accustomed freedom destroy may expect destroyed rebellion always watchword liberty its ancient privileges rallying point which neither time nor benefits ever cause forget whatever may provide against never forget name privileges unless disunited dispersed every chance immediately rally pisa after hundred years been held bondage florentines when cities countries accustomed live prince his family exterminated being one hand accustomed obey other hand having old prince cannot agree making one amongst themselves know how govern themselves reason very slow take arms prince gain himself secure much more easily republics there more vitality greater hatred more desire vengeance which never permit allow memory former liberty rest safest way destroy reside there concerning new principalities which acquired one s own arms ability let no one surprised if speaking entirely new principalities shall adduce highest examples both prince state because men walking almost always paths beaten others following imitation deeds yet unable keep entirely ways others attain power those imitate wise man ought always follow paths beaten great men imitate those who been supreme if his ability equal theirs least savour let act like clever archers who designing hit mark which yet appears too far distant knowing limits which strength bow attains take aim much higher mark reach strength arrow great height able aid high aim hit mark wish reach say therefore entirely new principalities where there new prince more less difficulty found keeping accordingly there more less ability who acquired state now fact becoming prince private station presupposes either ability fortune clear one other these things mitigate some degree many difficulties nevertheless who relied least fortune established strongest further facilitates matters when prince having no other state compelled reside there person come those who own ability through fortune risen princes say moses cyrus romulus theseus such like most excellent examples although one may discuss moses having been mere executor god yet ought admired if only favour which made worthy speak god considering cyrus others who acquired founded kingdoms all found admirable if particular deeds conduct shall considered found inferior those moses although great preceptor examining actions lives one cannot see owed anything fortune beyond opportunity which brought material mould form which seemed best without opportunity powers mind been extinguished without those powers opportunity come vain necessary therefore moses should find people israel egypt enslaved oppressed egyptians order should disposed follow delivered bondage necessary romulus should remain alba should abandoned his birth order should become king rome founder fatherland necessary cyrus should find persians discontented government medes medes soft effeminate through long peace theseus shown his ability found athenians dispersed these opportunities therefore made those men fortunate high ability enabled recognize opportunity whereby country ennobled made famous those who valorous ways become princes like these men acquire principality difficulty keep ease difficulties acquiring rise part new rules methods which forced introduce establish government its security ought remembered there nothing more difficult take hand more perilous conduct more uncertain its success take lead introduction new order things because innovator enemies all those who done well old conditions lukewarm defenders those who may well new coolness arises partly fear opponents who laws side partly incredulity men who readily believe new things until long experience thus happens whenever those who hostile opportunity attack like partisans whilst others defend lukewarmly such wise prince endangered along necessary therefore if desire discuss matter thoroughly inquire whether these innovators rely themselves depend others say whether consummate enterprise use prayers use force first instance always succeed badly never compass anything when rely themselves use force rarely endangered hence all armed prophets conquered unarmed ones been destroyed besides reasons mentioned nature people variable whilst easy persuade difficult fix persuasion thus necessary take such measures when believe no longer may possible make believe force if moses cyrus theseus romulus been unarmed enforced constitutions long happened time

thousand anxieties kept little trouble other hand cesare borgia called people duke valentino acquired his state during ascendancy his father its decline lost notwithstanding taken every measure done all ought done wise able man fix firmly his roots states which arms fortunes others bestowed 2 francesco sforza born 1401 died 1466 married bianca maria visconti natural daughter filippo visconti duke

his letters his chiefs florence left account written ten years before prince proceedings duke his descritione del modo tenuto dal duca valentino nello ammazzare vitellozzo vitelli etc translation which appended present work because stated above who first laid his foundations may able great ability lay afterwards laid trouble architect danger building if therefore all steps taken duke considered seen laid solid foundations his future power consider superfluous discuss because know what better precepts give new prince example his actions if his dispositions no avail his fault extraordinary extreme malignity fortune alexander sixth wishing aggrandize duke his son many immediate prospective difficulties firstly see his way make master any state state church if willing rob church knew duke milan venetians consent because faenza rimini already protection venetians besides saw arms italy especially those which might been assisted hands fear aggrandizement pope namely orsini colonnesi following behoved therefore upset state affairs embroil powers make himself securely master part states easy because found venetians moved other reasons inclined bring back french italy only oppose render more easy dissolving former marriage king louis therefore king came italy assistance venetians consent alexander no sooner milan pope soldiers attempt romagna which yielded reputation king duke therefore having acquired romagna beaten colonnesi while wishing hold advance further hindered two things one his forces appear loyal other goodwill france say feared forces orsini which using stand only might hinder winning more might themselves seize what won king might also same orsini warning when after taking faenza attacking bologna saw go very unwillingly attack king learned his mind when himself after taking duchy urbino attacked tuscany king made desist undertaking hence duke decided depend no more upon arms luck others first thing weakened orsini colonnesi parties rome gaining himself all adherents who gentlemen making his gentlemen giving good pay according rank honouring office command such way few months all attachment factions destroyed turned entirely duke after awaited opportunity crush orsini having scattered adherents colonna house came soon used well orsini perceiving length aggrandizement duke church ruin called meeting magione perugia sprung rebellion urbino tumults romagna endless dangers duke all which overcame help french having restored his authority leave risk trusting either french other outside forces recourse his wiles knew well how conceal his mind mediation signor pagolo whom duke fail secure all kinds attention giving money apparel horses orsini reconciled simplicity brought his power sinigalia 3 having exterminated leaders turned partisans his friends duke laid sufficiently good foundations his power having all romagna duchy urbino people now beginning appreciate prosperity gained all himself point worthy notice imitated others am willing leave 3 sinigalia 31st december 1502 when duke occupied romagna found rule weak masters who rather plundered subjects ruled gave more cause disunion union country full robbery quarrels every kind violence wishing bring back peace obedience authority considered necessary give good governor thereupon promoted messer ramiro d orco 4 swift cruel man whom gave fullest power man short time restored peace unity greatest success afterwards duke considered advisable confer such excessive authority no doubt become odious set court judgment country most excellent president wherein all cities advocates because knew past severity caused some hatred against himself clear himself minds people gain entirely himself desired show if any cruelty been practised originated natural sternness minister pretence took ramiro one morning caused executed left piazza cesena block bloody knife his side barbarity spectacle caused people once satisfied dismayed 4 ramiro d orco ramiro de lorqua let us return whence started say duke finding himself now sufficiently powerful partly secured immediate dangers having armed himself his own way having great measure crushed those forces his vicinity injure if wished proceed his conquest next consider france knew king who too late aware his mistake support time began seek new alliances temporize france expedition which making towards kingdom naples against spaniards who besieging gaeta his intention secure himself against quickly accomplished alexander lived such his line action present affairs future fear first place new successor church might friendly might seek take which alexander given decided act four ways firstly exterminating families those lords whom despoiled take away pretext pope secondly winning himself all gentlemen rome able curb pope aid been observed thirdly converting college more himself fourthly acquiring much power before pope should die his own measures resist first shock these four things death alexander accomplished three killed many dispossessed lords lay hands few escaped won roman gentlemen most numerous party college any fresh acquisition intended become master tuscany already possessed perugia piombino pisa his protection no longer study france french already driven kingdom naples spaniards way both compelled buy his goodwill pounced upon pisa after lucca siena yielded once partly through hatred partly through fear florentines florentines no remedy continued prosper prospering year alexander died acquired much power reputation stood himself no longer depended luck forces others solely his own power ability alexander died five years after first drawn sword left duke state romagna alone consolidated rest air between two most powerful hostile armies sick unto death yet there duke such boldness ability knew well how men won lost firm foundations which short time laid if those armies his back if been good health overcome all difficulties seen his foundations good romagna awaited more month rome although half alive remained secure whilst baglioni vitelli orsini might come rome effect anything against if made pope whom wished least one whom wish been elected if been sound health death alexander 5 everything been different day julius second 6 elected told thought everything might occur death his father provided remedy all except never anticipated when death happen himself point die 5 alexander died fever 18th august 1503 6 julius giuliano della rovere cardinal san pietro ad vincula born 1443 died 1513 when all actions duke recalled know how blame rather appears said ought offer imitation all those who fortune arms others raised government because having lofty spirit far reaching aims regulated his conduct otherwise only shortness life alexander his own sickness frustrated his designs therefore who considers necessary secure himself his new principality win friends overcome either force fraud make himself beloved feared people followed revered soldiers exterminate those who power reason hurt change old order things new severe gracious magnanimous liberal destroy disloyal soldiery create new maintain friendship kings princes such way must help zeal offend caution cannot find more lively example actions man only blamed election julius second whom made bad choice because said being able elect pope his own mind hindered any other being elected pope ought never consented election any cardinal whom injured who cause fear if became pontiffs men injure either fear hatred those whom injured amongst others san pietro ad vincula colonna san giorgio ascanio 7 rest becoming pope fear rouen spaniards excepted latter relationship obligations former his influence kingdom france having relations therefore above everything duke ought created spaniard pope failing ought consented rouen san pietro ad vincula who believes new benefits cause great personages forget old injuries deceived therefore duke erred his choice cause his ultimate ruin 7 san giorgio raffaello riario ascanio ascanio sforza concerning those who obtained principality wickedness although prince may rise private station two ways neither which entirely attributed fortune genius yet manifest must silent although one more copiously treated when discuss republics these methods when either some wicked nefarious ways one ascends principality when favour his fellow citizens private person becomes prince his country speaking first method illustrated two examples one ancient other modern without entering further subject consider these two examples suffice those who may compelled follow agathocles sicilian 1 became king syracuse only private low abject position man son potter through all changes his fortunes always led infamous life nevertheless accompanied his infamies much ability mind body having devoted himself military profession rose through its ranks praetor syracuse being established position having deliberately resolved make himself prince seize violence without obligation others which been conceded assent came understanding purpose amilcar carthaginian who his army fighting sicily one morning assembled people senate syracuse if discuss things relating republic given signal soldiers killed all senators richest people these dead seized held princedom city without any civil commotion although twice routed carthaginians ultimately besieged yet only able defend his city leaving part his men its defence others attacked africa short time raised siege syracuse carthaginians reduced extreme necessity compelled come terms agathocles leaving sicily content possession africa 1 agathocles sicilian born 361 b c died 289 b c therefore who considers actions genius man see nothing little which attributed fortune inasmuch attained pre eminence shown above favour any one step step military profession which steps gained thousand troubles perils afterwards boldly held many hazardous dangers yet cannot called talent slay fellow citizens deceive friends without faith without mercy without religion such methods may gain empire glory still if courage agathocles entering extricating himself dangers considered together his greatness mind enduring overcoming hardships cannot seen why should esteemed less most notable captain nevertheless his barbarous cruelty inhumanity infinite wickedness permit celebrated among most excellent men what achieved cannot attributed either fortune genius times during rule alexander sixth oliverotto da fermo having been left orphan many years before brought his maternal uncle giovanni fogliani early days his youth sent fight pagolo vitelli being trained his discipline might attain some high position military profession after pagolo died fought his brother vitellozzo very short time being endowed wit vigorous body mind became first man his profession appearing paltry thing serve others resolved aid some citizens fermo whom slavery country dearer its liberty help vitelleschi seize fermo wrote giovanni fogliani having been away home many years wished visit his city some measure look upon his patrimony although laboured acquire anything except honour yet order citizens should see spent his time vain desired come honourably accompanied one hundred horsemen his friends retainers entreated giovanni arrange should received honourably fermians all which only his honour also giovanni himself who brought giovanni therefore fail any attentions due his nephew caused honourably received fermians lodged his own house where having passed some days having arranged what necessary his wicked designs oliverotto gave solemn banquet which invited giovanni fogliani chiefs fermo when viands all other entertainments usual such banquets finished oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses speaking greatness pope alexander his son cesare enterprises which discourse giovanni others answered rose once saying such matters ought discussed more private place betook himself chamber whither giovanni rest citizens went after no sooner seated soldiers issued secret places slaughtered giovanni rest after these murders oliverotto mounted horseback rode town besieged chief magistrate palace fear people forced obey form government which made himself prince killed all malcontents who able injure strengthened himself new civil military ordinances such way year during which held principality only secure city fermo become formidable all his neighbours his destruction been difficult agathocles if allowed himself overreached cesare borgia who took orsini vitelli sinigalia stated above thus one year after committed parricide strangled together vitellozzo whom made his leader valour wickedness some may wonder how happen agathocles his like after infinite treacheries cruelties should live long secure his country defend himself external enemies never conspired against his own citizens seeing many others means cruelty never been able even peaceful times hold state still less doubtful times war believe follows severities 2 being badly properly used those may called properly used if evil possible speak well applied one blow necessary one s security persisted afterwards unless turned advantage subjects badly employed those which notwithstanding may few commencement multiply time rather decrease those who practise first system able aid god man mitigate some degree rule agathocles impossible those who follow other maintain themselves 2 mr burd suggests word probably comes near modern equivalent machiavelli s thought when speaks crudelta more obvious cruelties hence remarked seizing state usurper ought examine closely all those injuries which necessary inflict all one stroke repeat daily thus unsettling men able reassure win himself benefits who otherwise either timidity evil advice always compelled keep knife his hand neither rely his subjects nor attach themselves owing continued repeated wrongs injuries ought done all one time being tasted less offend less benefits ought given little little flavour may last longer above all things prince ought live amongst his people such way no unexpected circumstances whether good evil shall make change because if necessity comes troubled times too late harsh measures mild ones help considered forced no one any obligation concerning civil principality coming other point where leading citizen becomes prince his country wickedness any intolerable violence favour his fellow citizens may called civil principality nor genius fortune altogether necessary attain rather happy shrewdness say such principality obtained either favour people favour nobles because all cities these two distinct parties found arises people wish ruled nor oppressed nobles nobles wish rule oppress people these two opposite desires there arises cities one three results either principality self government anarchy principality created either people nobles accordingly one other opportunity nobles seeing cannot withstand people begin cry reputation one themselves make prince his shadow give vent ambitions people finding cannot resist nobles also cry reputation one themselves make prince defended his authority who obtains sovereignty assistance nobles maintains himself more difficulty who comes aid people because former finds himself many around who consider themselves his equals because neither rule nor manage his liking who reaches sovereignty popular favour finds himself alone none around few who prepared obey besides one cannot fair dealing without injury others satisfy nobles satisfy people object more righteous nobles latter wishing oppress while former only desire oppressed added also prince never secure himself against hostile people because there being too many whilst nobles secure himself few number worst prince may expect hostile people abandoned hostile nobles only fear abandonment also rise against being these affairs more far seeing astute always come forward time save themselves obtain favours whom expect prevail further prince compelled live always same people well without same nobles being able make unmake daily give take away authority when pleases therefore make point clearer say nobles ought looked mainly two ways say either shape course such way binds entirely fortune those who bind themselves rapacious ought honoured loved those who bind themselves may dealt two ways may fail through pusillanimity natural want courage which case ought make use especially those who good counsel thus whilst prosperity honour adversity fear when own ambitious ends shun binding themselves token giving more thought themselves prince ought guard against such fear if open enemies because adversity always help ruin therefore one who becomes prince through favour people ought keep friendly easily seeing only ask oppressed one who opposition people becomes prince favour nobles ought above everything seek win people himself may easily if takes his protection because men when receive good whom expecting evil bound more closely benefactor thus people quickly become more devoted if been raised principality favours prince win affections many ways these vary according circumstances one cannot give fixed rules omit repeat necessary prince people friendly otherwise no security adversity nabis 1 prince spartans sustained attack all greece victorious roman army against defended his country his government overcoming peril only necessary make himself secure against few been sufficient people been hostile let any one impugn statement trite proverb who builds people builds mud true when private citizen makes foundation there persuades himself people free when oppressed his enemies magistrates wherein find himself very often deceived happened gracchi rome messer giorgio scali 2 florence granted prince who established himself above who command man courage undismayed adversity who fail other qualifications who his resolution energy keeps whole people encouraged such one never find himself deceived shown laid his foundations well 1 nabis tyrant sparta conquered romans flamininus 195 b c killed 192 b c 2 messer giorgio scali event found machiavelli s florentine history book these principalities liable danger when passing civil absolute order government such princes either rule personally through magistrates latter case government weaker more insecure because rests entirely goodwill those citizens who raised magistracy who especially troubled times destroy government great ease either intrigue open defiance prince chance amid tumults exercise absolute authority because citizens subjects accustomed receive orders magistrates mind obey amid these confusions there always doubtful times scarcity men whom trust such prince cannot rely upon what observes quiet times when citizens need state because every one agrees all promise when death far distant all wish die troubled times when state need its citizens finds few much more experiment dangerous inasmuch only tried once therefore wise prince ought adopt such course his citizens always every sort kind circumstance need state always find faithful concerning way which strength all principalities ought measured necessary consider another point examining character these principalities whether prince such power case need support himself his own resources whether always need assistance others make quite clear say consider those who able support themselves own resources who either abundance men money raise sufficient army join battle against any one who comes attack consider those always need others who cannot show themselves against enemy field forced defend themselves sheltering behind walls first case been discussed speak again should recur second case one say nothing except encourage such princes provision fortify towns any account defend country whoever shall fortify his town well shall managed other concerns his subjects way stated above often repeated never attacked without great caution men always adverse enterprises where difficulties seen seen easy thing attack one who his town well fortified hated his people cities germany absolutely free own little country around yield obedience emperor when suits nor fear any other power may near because fortified such way every one thinks taking assault tedious difficult seeing proper ditches walls sufficient artillery always keep public depots enough one year s eating drinking firing beyond keep people quiet without loss state always means giving work community those labours life strength city pursuit which people supported also hold military exercises repute moreover many ordinances uphold therefore prince who strong city made himself odious attacked if any one should attack only driven off disgrace again because affairs world changeable almost impossible keep army whole year field without being interfered whoever should reply if people property outside city see burnt remain patient long siege self interest make forget prince answer powerful courageous prince overcome all such difficulties giving one time hope his subjects evil long another time fear cruelty enemy preserving himself adroitly those subjects who seem too bold further enemy naturally his arrival once burn ruin country time when spirits people still hot ready defence therefore much less ought prince hesitate because after time when spirits cooled damage already done ills incurred there no longer any remedy therefore much more ready unite prince appearing obligations now houses been burnt possessions ruined his defence nature men bound benefits confer much those receive therefore if everything well considered difficult wise prince keep minds his citizens steadfast first last when fail support defend concerning ecclesiastical principalities only remains now speak ecclesiastical principalities touching which all difficulties prior getting possession because acquired either capacity good fortune held without either sustained ancient ordinances religion which all powerful such character principalities may held no matter how princes behave live these princes alone states defend subjects rule states although unguarded taken subjects although ruled care neither desire nor ability alienate themselves such principalities only secure happy being upheld powers which human mind cannot reach shall speak no more because being exalted maintained god act presumptuous rash man discuss nevertheless if any one should ask how comes church attained such greatness temporal power seeing alexander backwards italian potentates only those who been called potentates every baron lord though smallest valued temporal power very slightly yet now king france trembles before been able drive italy ruin venetians although may very manifest appear superfluous recall some measure memory before charles king france passed italy 1 country dominion pope venetians king naples duke milan florentines these potentates two principal anxieties one no foreigner should enter italy arms other none themselves should seize more territory those whom there most anxiety pope venetians restrain venetians union all others necessary defence ferrara keep pope made use barons rome who being divided two factions orsini colonnesi always pretext disorder standing arms hands eyes pontiff kept pontificate weak powerless although there might arise sometimes courageous pope such sixtus yet neither fortune nor wisdom rid these annoyances short life pope also cause weakness ten years which average life pope difficulty lower one factions if speak one people should almost destroy colonnesi another arise hostile orsini who support opponents yet time ruin orsini reason why temporal powers pope little esteemed italy 1 charles invaded italy 1494 alexander sixth arose afterwards who all pontiffs ever been showed how pope both money arms able prevail through instrumentality duke valentino reason entry french brought all those things which discussed above actions duke although his intention aggrandize church duke nevertheless what contributed greatness church which after his death ruin duke became heir all his labours pope julius came afterwards found church strong possessing all romagna barons rome reduced impotence through chastisements alexander factions wiped also found way open accumulate money manner such never been practised before alexander s time such things julius only followed improved upon intended gain bologna ruin venetians drive french italy all these enterprises prospered much more his credit inasmuch everything strengthen church any private person kept also orsini colonnesi factions within bounds which found although there among some mind make disturbance nevertheless held two things firm one greatness church which terrified other allowing own cardinals who caused disorders among whenever these factions cardinals remain quiet long because cardinals foster factions rome barons compelled support thus ambitions prelates arise disorders tumults among barons these reasons his holiness pope leo 2 found pontificate most powerful hoped if others made great arms make still greater more venerated his goodness infinite other virtues 2 pope leo cardinal de medici how many kinds soldiery there concerning mercenaries having discoursed particularly characteristics such principalities beginning proposed discuss having considered some degree causes there being good bad having shown methods which many sought acquire hold now remains discuss generally means offence defence which belong each seen above how necessary prince his foundations well laid otherwise follows necessity go ruin chief foundations all states new well old composite good laws good arms there cannot good laws where state well armed follows where well armed good laws shall leave laws discussion shall speak arms say therefore arms which prince defends his state either his own mercenaries auxiliaries mixed mercenaries auxiliaries useless dangerous if one holds his state based these arms stand neither firm nor safe disunited ambitious without discipline unfaithful valiant before friends cowardly before enemies neither fear god nor fidelity men destruction deferred only long attack peace one robbed war enemy fact no other attraction reason keeping field trifle stipend which sufficient make willing die ready enough soldiers whilst make war if war comes take themselves off run foe which should little trouble prove ruin italy been caused nothing else resting all hopes many years mercenaries although formerly made some display appeared valiant amongst themselves yet when foreigners came showed what thus charles king france allowed seize italy chalk hand 1 who told us sins cause told truth sins imagined those which related sins princes princes who also suffered penalty 1 chalk hand col gesso one bons mots alexander refers ease which charles seized italy implying only necessary send his quartermasters chalk billets his soldiers conquer country cf history henry lord bacon king charles conquered realm naples lost again kind felicity dream passed whole length italy without resistance true what pope alexander wont say frenchmen came italy chalk hands mark lodgings rather swords fight wish demonstrate further infelicity these arms mercenary captains either capable men if cannot trust because always aspire own greatness either oppressing who master others contrary intentions if captain skilful ruined usual way if urged whoever armed act same way whether mercenary reply when arms resorted either prince republic prince ought go person perform duty captain republic send its citizens when one sent who turn satisfactorily ought recall when one worthy hold laws leave command experience shown princes republics single handed making greatest progress mercenaries doing nothing except damage more difficult bring republic armed its own arms sway one its citizens bring one armed foreign arms rome sparta stood many ages armed free switzers completely armed quite free ancient mercenaries example there carthaginians who oppressed mercenary soldiers after first war romans although carthaginians own citizens captains after death epaminondas philip macedon made captain soldiers thebans after victory took away liberty duke filippo being dead milanese enlisted francesco sforza against venetians having overcome enemy caravaggio 2 allied himself crush milanese his masters his father sforza having been engaged queen johanna 3 naples left unprotected forced throw herself arms king aragon order save kingdom if venetians florentines formerly extended dominions these arms yet captains make themselves princes defended reply florentines case been favoured chance able captains whom might stood fear some conquered some been opposed others turned ambitions elsewhere one who conquer giovanni acuto 4 since conquer his fidelity cannot proved every one acknowledge conquered florentines stood his discretion sforza bracceschi always against watched each other francesco turned his ambition lombardy braccio against church kingdom naples let us come which happened short while ago florentines appointed captain pagolo vitelli most prudent man who private position risen greatest renown if man taken pisa nobody deny been proper florentines keep if became soldier enemies no means resisting if held must obey venetians if achievements considered seen acted safely gloriously long sent war own men when armed gentlemen plebians valiantly before turned enterprises land when began fight land forsook virtue followed custom italy beginning expansion land through having much territory because great reputation much fear captains when expanded carmignuola 5 taste mistake having found most valiant man beat duke milan his leadership other hand knowing how lukewarm war feared no longer conquer reason willing nor able let go lose again which acquired compelled order secure themselves murder afterwards captains bartolomeo da bergamo roberto da san severino count pitigliano 6 like whom dread loss gain happened afterwards vaila 7 where one battle lost which eight hundred years acquired much trouble because such arms conquests come slowly long

mercenaries wish discuss more seriously order having seen rise progress one may better prepared counteract must understand empire recently come repudiated italy pope acquired more temporal power italy been divided more states reason many great cities took arms against nobles who formerly favoured emperor oppressing whilst church favouring gain authority temporal power many others citizens became princes came pass italy fell partly hands church republics church consisting priests republic citizens unaccustomed arms both commenced enlist foreigners first who gave renown soldiery alberigo da conio 8 romagnian school man sprang among others braccio sforza who time arbiters italy after these came all other captains who till now directed arms italy end all valour been been overrun charles robbed louis ravaged ferdinand insulted switzers principle guided been first lower credit infantry might increase own because subsisting pay without territory unable support many soldiers few infantry give any authority led employ cavalry moderate force which maintained honoured affairs brought such pass army twenty thousand soldiers there found two thousand foot soldiers besides used every art lessen fatigue danger themselves soldiers killing fray taking prisoners liberating without ransom attack towns night nor garrisons towns attack encampments night surround camp either stockade ditch nor campaign winter all these things permitted military rules devised avoid said both fatigue dangers thus brought italy slavery contempt 8 alberigo da conio alberico da barbiano count cunio romagna leader famous company st george composed entirely italian soldiers died 1409 concerning auxiliaries mixed soldiery one s own auxiliaries which other useless arm employed when prince called his forces aid defend done pope julius most recent times having enterprise against ferrara poor proof his mercenaries turned auxiliaries stipulated ferdinand king spain 1 his assistance men arms these arms may useful good themselves who calls always disadvantageous losing one undone winning one captive 1 ferdinand f aragon sicily f naples surnamed catholic born 1452 died 1516 although ancient histories may full examples wish leave recent one pope julius second peril which cannot fail perceived wishing get ferrara threw himself entirely hands foreigner his good fortune brought third event reap fruit his rash choice because having his auxiliaries routed ravenna switzers having risen driven conquerors against all expectation both his others came pass become prisoner his enemies having fled nor his auxiliaries having conquered other arms theirs florentines being entirely without arms sent ten thousand frenchmen take pisa whereby ran more danger any other time troubles emperor constantinople 2 oppose his neighbours sent ten thousand turks greece who war being finished willing quit beginning servitude greece infidels 2 joannes cantacuzenus born 1300 died 1383 therefore let who no desire conquer make use these arms much more hazardous mercenaries because ruin ready made all united all yield obedience others mercenaries when conquered more time better opportunities needed injure all one community found paid third party which made head able all once assume enough authority injure conclusion mercenaries dastardy most dangerous auxiliaries valour wise prince therefore always avoided these arms turned his own been willing rather lose conquer others deeming real victory which gained arms others shall never hesitate cite cesare borgia his actions duke entered romagna auxiliaries taking there only french soldiers captured imola forli afterwards such forces appearing reliable turned mercenaries discerning less danger enlisted orsini vitelli whom presently handling finding doubtful unfaithful dangerous destroyed turned his own men difference between one other these forces easily seen when one considers difference there reputation duke when french when orsini vitelli when relied his own soldiers whose fidelity always count found ever increasing never esteemed more highly when every one saw complete master his own forces intending go beyond italian recent examples am unwilling leave hiero syracusan being one those named above man said made head army syracusans soon found mercenary soldiery constituted like italian condottieri no use appearing neither keep nor let go all cut pieces afterwards made war his own forces aliens wish also recall memory instance old testament applicable subject david offered himself saul fight goliath philistine champion give courage saul armed his own weapons which david rejected soon his back saying make no use wished meet enemy his sling his knife conclusion arms others either fall back weigh bind fast charles seventh 3 father king louis eleventh 4 having good fortune valour liberated france english recognized necessity being armed forces his own established his kingdom ordinances concerning men arms infantry afterwards his son king louis abolished infantry began enlist switzers which mistake followed others now seen source peril kingdom because having raised reputation switzers entirely diminished value his own arms destroyed infantry altogether his men arms subordinated others being accustomed fight along switzers appear now conquer without hence arises french cannot stand against switzers without switzers come off well against others armies french thus become mixed partly mercenary partly national both which arms together much better mercenaries alone auxiliaries alone much inferior one s own forces example proves kingdom france unconquerable if ordinance charles been enlarged maintained 3 charles france surnamed victorious born 1403 died 1461 4 louis son above born 1423 died 1483 scanty wisdom man entering affair which looks well first cannot discern poison hidden said above hectic fevers therefore if who rules principality cannot recognize evils until upon truly wise insight given few if first disaster roman empire 5 should examined found commenced only enlisting goths because time vigour roman empire began decline all valour which raised passed away others 5 many speakers house other night debate reduction armaments seemed show most lamentable ignorance conditions which british empire maintains its existence when mr balfour replied allegations roman empire sank weight its military obligations said wholly unhistorical might well added roman power its zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability fight state began decline soon obligation no longer recognised pall mall gazette 15th may 1906 conclude therefore no principality secure without having its own forces contrary entirely dependent good fortune having valour which adversity defend always been opinion judgment wise men nothing uncertain unstable fame power founded its own strength one s own forces those which composed either subjects citizens dependents all others mercenaries auxiliaries way make ready one s own forces easily found if rules suggested shall reflected upon if one consider how philip father alexander great many republics princes armed organized themselves which rules entirely commit myself which concerns prince subject art war prince ought no other aim thought nor select anything else his study war its rules discipline sole art belongs who rules such force only upholds those who born princes often enables men rise private station rank contrary seen when princes thought more ease arms lost states first cause losing neglect art what enables acquire state master art francesco sforza through being martial private person became duke milan sons through avoiding hardships troubles arms dukes became private persons among other evils which being unarmed brings causes despised one those ignominies against which prince ought guard himself shown later because there nothing proportionate between armed unarmed reasonable who armed should yield obedience willingly who unarmed unarmed man should secure among armed servants because there being one disdain other suspicion possible work well together therefore prince who understand art war above other misfortunes already mentioned cannot respected his soldiers nor rely ought never therefore his thoughts subject war peace should addict himself more its exercise war two ways one action other study regards action ought above all things keep his men well organized drilled follow incessantly chase which accustoms his body hardships learns something nature localities gets find how mountains rise how valleys open how plains lie understand nature rivers marshes all take greatest care which knowledge useful two ways firstly learns know his country better able undertake its defence afterwards

prince ought observe some such rules never peaceful times stand idle increase his resources industry such way may available adversity if fortune chances may find prepared resist blows concerning things which men especially princes praised blamed remains now see what ought rules conduct prince towards subject friends know many written point expect shall considered presumptuous mentioning again especially discussing shall depart methods other people being intention write thing which shall useful who apprehends appears more appropriate follow real truth matter imagination many pictured

wishes act entirely his professions virtue soon meets what destroys among much evil hence necessary prince wishing hold his own know how wrong make use according necessity therefore putting one side imaginary things concerning prince discussing those which real say all men when spoken chiefly princes being more highly placed remarkable some those qualities which bring either blame praise thus one reputed liberal another miserly using tuscan term because avaricious person language still who desires possess robbery whilst call one miserly who deprives himself too much use his own one reputed generous one rapacious one cruel one compassionate one faithless another faithful one effeminate cowardly another bold brave one affable another haughty one lascivious another chaste one sincere another cunning one hard another easy one grave another frivolous one religious another unbelieving like know every one confess most praiseworthy prince exhibit all above qualities considered good because neither entirely possessed nor observed human conditions permit necessary sufficiently prudent may know how avoid reproach those vices which lose his state also keep himself if possible those which lose being possible may less hesitation abandon himself again need make himself uneasy incurring reproach those vices without which state only saved difficulty if everything considered carefully

esteemed easily conspired against provided well known excellent man revered his people only attacked difficulty reason prince ought two fears one within account his subjects other without account external powers latter defended being well armed having good allies if well armed good friends affairs always remain quiet within when quiet without unless should been already disturbed conspiracy even should affairs outside disturbed if carried his preparations lived said long despair resist every attack said nabis spartan concerning his subjects when affairs outside disturbed only fear conspire secretly which prince easily secure himself avoiding being hated despised keeping people satisfied which most necessary accomplish said above length one most efficacious remedies prince against conspiracies hated despised people who conspires against prince always expects please his removal when conspirator only look forward offending courage take such course difficulties confront conspirator infinite experience shows many been conspiracies few been successful because who conspires cannot act alone nor take companion except those whom believes malcontents soon opened mind malcontent given material which content himself denouncing look every advantage seeing gain course assured seeing other doubtful full dangers must very rare friend thoroughly obstinate enemy prince keep faith reduce matter small compass say side conspirator there nothing fear jealousy prospect punishment terrify side prince there majesty principality laws protection friends state defend adding all these things popular goodwill impossible any one should rash conspire whereas general conspirator fear before execution his plot case also fear sequel crime because account people enemy thus cannot hope any escape endless examples given subject content one brought pass within memory fathers messer annibale bentivogli who prince bologna grandfather present annibale having been murdered canneschi who conspired against one his family survived messer giovanni 1 who childhood immediately after his assassination people rose murdered all canneschi sprung popular goodwill which house bentivogli enjoyed those days bologna which great although none remained there after death annibale who able rule state bolognese having information there one bentivogli family florence who time been

machiavelli s strong condemnation conspiracies may get its edge his own very recent experience february 1513 when been arrested tortured his alleged complicity boscoli conspiracy reason consider prince ought reckon conspiracies little account when his people hold esteem when hostile bears hatred towards ought fear everything everybody well ordered states wise princes taken every care drive nobles desperation keep people satisfied contented one most important objects prince among best ordered governed kingdoms times france found many good institutions which depend liberty security king these first parliament its authority because who founded kingdom knowing ambition nobility boldness considered bit mouths necessary hold other side knowing hatred people founded fear against nobles wished protect yet anxious particular care king therefore take away reproach which liable nobles favouring people people favouring nobles set arbiter who should one who beat great favour lesser without reproach king neither better more prudent arrangement greater source security king kingdom one draw another important conclusion princes ought leave affairs reproach management others keep those grace own hands further consider prince ought cherish nobles make himself hated people may appear perhaps some who examined lives deaths roman emperors many example contrary opinion seeing some lived nobly showed great qualities soul nevertheless lost empire been killed subjects who conspired against wishing therefore answer these objections recall characters some emperors show causes ruin different those alleged same time only submit consideration those things noteworthy who studies affairs those times seems sufficient take all those emperors who succeeded empire marcus philosopher maximinus marcus his son commodus pertinax julian severus his son antoninus caracalla macrinus heliogabalus alexander maximinus there first note whereas other principalities ambition nobles insolence people only contended roman emperors third difficulty having put cruelty avarice soldiers matter beset difficulties ruin many hard thing give satisfaction both soldiers people because people loved peace reason loved unaspiring prince whilst soldiers loved warlike prince who bold cruel rapacious which qualities quite willing should exercise upon people get double pay give vent own greed cruelty hence arose those emperors always overthrown who either birth training no great authority most especially those who came new principality recognizing difficulty these two opposing humours inclined give satisfaction soldiers caring little injuring people which course necessary because princes cannot help being hated someone ought first place avoid being hated every one when cannot compass ought endeavour utmost diligence avoid hatred most powerful therefore those emperors who through inexperience need special favour adhered more readily soldiers people course which turned advantageous accordingly prince knew how maintain authority these causes arose marcus pertinax alexander being all men modest life lovers justice enemies cruelty humane benignant came sad end except marcus alone lived died honoured because succeeded throne hereditary title owed nothing either soldiers people afterwards being possessed many virtues which made respected always kept both orders places whilst lived neither hated nor despised pertinax created emperor against wishes soldiers who being accustomed live licentiously commodus endure honest life which pertinax wished reduce thus having given cause hatred which hatred there added contempt his old age overthrown very beginning his administration here should noted hatred acquired much good works bad ones therefore said before prince wishing keep his state very often forced evil when body corrupt whom think need maintain yourself may either people soldiers nobles submit its humours gratify good works harm let us come alexander who man such great goodness among other praises which accorded fourteen years held empire no one ever put death unjudged nevertheless being considered effeminate man who allowed himself governed his mother became despised army conspired against murdered turning now opposite characters commodus severus antoninus caracalla maximinus find all cruel rapacious men who satisfy soldiers hesitate commit every kind iniquity against people all except severus came bad end severus there much valour keeping soldiers friendly although people oppressed reigned successfully his valour made much admired sight soldiers people latter kept way astonished awed former respectful satisfied because actions man new prince great wish show briefly knew well how counterfeit fox lion which natures said above necessary prince imitate knowing sloth emperor julian persuaded army sclavonia which captain right go rome avenge death pertinax who been killed praetorian soldiers pretext without appearing aspire throne moved army rome reached italy before known started his arrival rome senate through fear elected emperor killed julian after there remained severus who wished make himself master whole empire two difficulties one asia where niger head asiatic army caused himself proclaimed emperor other west where albinus who also aspired throne considered dangerous declare himself hostile both decided attack niger deceive albinus latter wrote being elected emperor senate willing share dignity sent title caesar moreover senate made albinus his colleague which things accepted albinus true after severus conquered killed niger settled oriental affairs returned rome complained senate albinus little recognizing benefits received treachery sought murder ingratitude compelled punish afterwards sought france took his government life who therefore carefully examine actions man find most valiant lion most cunning fox find feared respected every one hated army need wondered new man able hold empire well because his supreme renown always protected hatred which people might conceived against his violence his son antoninus most eminent man very excellent qualities which made admirable sight people acceptable soldiers warlike man most enduring fatigue despiser all delicate food other luxuries which caused beloved armies nevertheless his ferocity cruelties great unheard after endless single murders killed large number people rome all those alexandria became hated whole world also feared those around such extent murdered midst his army centurion here must noted such like deaths which deliberately inflicted resolved desperate courage cannot avoided princes because any one who fear die inflict prince may fear less because very rare only careful any grave injury those whom employs around service state antoninus taken care contumeliously killed brother centurion whom also daily threatened yet retained his bodyguard which turned rash thing proved emperor s ruin let us come commodus whom should been very easy hold empire being son marcus inherited only follow footsteps his father please his people soldiers being nature cruel brutal gave himself amusing soldiers corrupting might indulge his rapacity upon people other hand maintaining his dignity often descending theatre compete gladiators doing other vile things little worthy imperial majesty fell contempt soldiers being hated one party despised other conspired against killed remains discuss character maximinus very warlike man armies being disgusted effeminacy alexander whom already spoken killed elected maximinus throne possess long two things made hated despised one his having kept sheep thrace which brought contempt being well known all considered great indignity every one other his having accession his dominions deferred going rome taking possession imperial seat also gained reputation utmost ferocity having through his prefects rome elsewhere empire practised many cruelties whole world moved anger meanness his birth fear his barbarity first africa rebelled senate all people rome all italy conspired against which may added his own army latter besieging aquileia meeting difficulties taking disgusted his cruelties fearing less when found many against murdered wish discuss heliogabalus macrinus julian who being thoroughly contemptible quickly wiped bring discourse conclusion saying princes times difficulty giving inordinate satisfaction soldiers far less degree because notwithstanding one give some indulgence soon done none these princes armies veterans governance administration provinces armies roman empire whereas more necessary give satisfaction soldiers people now more necessary all princes except turk soldan satisfy people rather soldiers because people more powerful above excepted turk who always keeps round twelve thousand infantry fifteen thousand cavalry which depend security strength kingdom necessary putting aside every consideration people should keep his friends kingdom soldan similar being entirely hands soldiers follows again without regard people must keep his friends must note state soldan unlike all other principalities reason like christian pontificate which cannot called either hereditary newly formed principality because sons old prince heirs who elected position those who authority sons remain only noblemen being ancient custom cannot called new principality because there none those difficulties met new ones although prince new constitution state old framed receive if its hereditary lord returning subject discourse say whoever consider acknowledge either hatred contempt been fatal above named emperors recognized also how happened number acting one way number another only one each way came happy end rest unhappy ones because been useless dangerous pertinax alexander being new princes imitate marcus who heir principality likewise been utterly destructive caracalla commodus maximinus imitated severus having sufficient valour enable tread his footsteps therefore prince new principality cannot imitate actions marcus nor again necessary follow those severus ought take severus those parts which necessary found his state marcus those which proper glorious keep state may already stable firm fortresses many other things which princes often resort advantageous hurtful 1 some princes hold securely state disarmed subjects others kept subject towns distracted factions others fostered enmities against themselves others laid themselves gain those whom distrusted beginning governments some built fortresses some overthrown destroyed although one cannot give final judgment all these things unless one possesses particulars those states which decision made nevertheless speak comprehensively matter itself admit 2 there never new prince who disarmed his subjects rather when found disarmed always armed because arming those arms become yours those men who distrusted become faithful those who faithful kept subjects become adherents whereas all subjects cannot armed yet when those whom arm benefited others handled more freely difference treatment which quite understand makes former dependents latter considering necessary those who most danger service should most reward excuse when disarm once offend showing distrust either cowardice want loyalty either these opinions breeds hatred against because cannot remain unarmed follows turn mercenaries which character already shown even if should good sufficient defend against powerful enemies distrusted subjects therefore said new prince new principality always distributed arms histories full examples when prince acquires new state which adds province his old one necessary disarm men state except those who been his adherents acquiring these again time opportunity should rendered soft effeminate matters should managed such way all armed men state shall own soldiers who old state living near 3 forefathers those who reckoned wise accustomed say necessary hold pistoia factions pisa fortresses idea fostered quarrels some tributary towns keep possession more easily may been well enough those times when italy way balanced believe accepted precept day because believe factions ever use rather certain when enemy comes upon divided cities quickly lost because weakest party always assist outside forces other able resist venetians moved believe above reasons fostered guelph ghibelline factions tributary cities although never allowed come bloodshed yet nursed these disputes amongst citizens distracted differences should unite against which saw afterwards turn expected because after rout vaila one party once took courage seized state such methods argue therefore weakness prince because these factions never permitted vigorous principality such methods enabling one more easily manage subjects only useful times peace if war comes policy proves fallacious 4 without doubt princes become great when overcome difficulties obstacles which confronted therefore fortune especially when desires make new prince great who greater necessity earn renown hereditary one causes enemies arise form designs against order may opportunity overcoming mount higher ladder which his enemies raised reason many consider wise prince when opportunity ought craft foster some animosity against himself having crushed his renown may rise higher 5 princes especially new ones found more fidelity assistance those men who beginning rule distrusted among those who beginning trusted pandolfo petrucci prince siena ruled his state more those who been distrusted others question one cannot speak generally varies much individual only say those men who commencement princedom been hostile if description need assistance support themselves always gained greatest ease tightly held serve prince fidelity inasmuch know very necessary cancel deeds bad impression which formed thus prince always extracts more profit those who serving too much security may neglect his affairs since matter demands must fail warn prince who means secret favours acquired new state must well consider reasons which induced those favour who if natural affection towards only discontent government only keep friendly great trouble difficulty impossible satisfy weighing well reasons those examples which taken ancient modern affairs shall find easier prince make friends those men who contented former government therefore his enemies those who being discontented favourable encouraged seize 6 been custom princes order hold states more securely build fortresses may serve bridle bit those who might design work against place refuge first attack praise system because been made use formerly notwithstanding messer nicolo vitelli times been seen demolish two fortresses citta di castello might keep state guido ubaldo duke urbino returning his dominion whence been driven cesare borgia razed foundations all fortresses province considered without more difficult lose bentivogli returning bologna came similar decision fortresses therefore useful according circumstances if good one way injure another question reasoned thus prince who more fear people foreigners ought build fortresses who more fear foreigners people ought leave alone castle milan built francesco sforza made make more trouble house sforza any other disorder state reason best possible fortress hated people because although may hold fortresses yet save if people hate there never wanting foreigners assist people who taken arms against been seen times such fortresses been use any prince unless countess forli 1 when count girolamo consort killed means able withstand popular attack wait assistance milan thus recover state posture affairs such time foreigners assist people fortresses little value afterwards when cesare borgia attacked when people enemy allied foreigners therefore been safer both before been hated people fortresses all these things considered shall praise who builds fortresses well who shall blame whoever trusting cares little being hated people 1 catherine sforza daughter galeazzo sforza lucrezia landriani born 1463 died

secretary lords ten leave once cf catherine sforza count pasolini translated p sylvester 1898 how prince should conduct himself gain renown nothing makes prince much esteemed great enterprises setting fine example time ferdinand aragon present king spain almost called new prince because risen fame glory being insignificant king foremost king christendom if consider his deeds find all great some extraordinary beginning his reign attacked granada enterprise foundation his dominions quietly first without any fear hindrance held minds barons castile occupied thinking war anticipating any innovations thus perceive these means acquiring power authority able money church people sustain his armies long war lay foundation military skill which since distinguished further always using religion plea undertake greater schemes devoted himself pious cruelty driving clearing his kingdom moors nor there more admirable example nor one more rare same cloak assailed africa came italy finally attacked france thus his achievements designs always been great kept minds his people suspense admiration occupied issue his actions arisen such way one other men never been given time work steadily against again much assists prince set unusual examples internal affairs similar those which related messer bernabo da milano who when opportunity any one civil life doing some extraordinary thing either good bad take some method rewarding punishing which much spoken prince ought above all things always endeavour every action gain himself reputation being great remarkable man prince also respected when either true friend downright enemy say when without any reservation declares himself favour one party against other which course always more advantageous standing neutral because if two powerful neighbours come blows such character if one conquers either fear either case always more advantageous declare yourself make war strenuously because first case if declare yourself invariably fall prey conqueror pleasure satisfaction who been conquered no reasons offer nor anything protect shelter because who conquers want doubtful friends who aid time trial who loses harbour because willingly sword hand court his fate antiochus went greece being sent tolians drive romans sent envoys achaeans who friends romans exhorting remain neutral other hand romans urged take arms question came discussed council achaeans where legate antiochus urged stand neutral roman legate answered which been said better more advantageous state interfere war nothing more erroneous because interfering left without favour consideration guerdon conqueror thus always happen who friend demand neutrality whilst who friend entreat declare yourself arms irresolute princes avoid present dangers generally follow neutral path generally ruined when prince declares himself gallantly favour one side if party whom allies himself conquers although victor may powerful may his mercy yet indebted there established bond amity men never shameless become monument ingratitude oppressing victories after all never complete victor must show some regard especially justice if whom ally yourself loses may sheltered whilst able may aid become companions fortune may rise again second case when those who fight such character no anxiety who may conquer much more greater prudence allied because assist destruction one aid another who if been wise saved conquering impossible should assistance remains discretion here noted prince ought take care never make alliance one more powerful himself purposes attacking others unless necessity compels said above because if conquers his discretion princes ought avoid much possible being discretion any one venetians joined france against duke milan alliance which caused ruin been avoided when cannot avoided happened florentines when pope spain sent armies attack lombardy such case above reasons prince ought favour one parties never let any government imagine choose perfectly safe courses rather let expect take very doubtful ones because found ordinary affairs one never seeks avoid one trouble without running another prudence consists knowing how distinguish character troubles choice take lesser evil prince ought also show himself patron ability honour proficient every art same time should encourage his citizens practise callings peaceably both commerce agriculture every other following one should deterred improving his possessions fear lest taken away another opening trade fear taxes prince ought offer rewards whoever wishes these things designs any way honour his city state further ought entertain people festivals spectacles convenient seasons year every city divided guilds societies 1 ought hold such bodies esteem associate

connected marriage perhaps words sects clans most appropriate concerning secretaries princes choice servants no little importance prince good according discrimination prince first opinion which one forms prince his understanding observing men around when capable faithful may always considered wise because known how recognize capable keep faithful when otherwise one cannot form good opinion prime error which made choosing there none who knew messer antonio da venafro servant pandolfo petrucci prince siena who consider pandolfo very clever man having venafro his servant because there three classes intellects one which comprehends itself another which appreciates what others comprehended third which neither comprehends itself nor showing others first most excellent second good third useless therefore follows necessarily if pandolfo first rank second whenever one judgment know good bad when said done although himself may initiative yet recognize good bad his servant one praise other correct thus servant cannot hope deceive kept honest enable prince form opinion his servant there one test which never fails when see servant thinking more his own interests yours seeking inwardly his own profit everything such man never make good servant nor ever able trust because who state another his hands ought never think himself always his prince never pay any attention matters which prince concerned other hand keep his servant honest prince ought study honouring enriching doing kindnesses sharing honours cares same time let see cannot stand alone many honours may make desire more many riches make wish more many cares may make dread chances when therefore servants princes towards servants thus disposed trust each other when otherwise end always disastrous either one other how flatterers should avoided wish leave important branch subject danger which princes difficulty preserved unless very careful discriminating flatterers whom courts full because men self complacent own affairs way deceived preserved difficulty pest if wish defend themselves run danger falling contempt because there no other way guarding oneself flatterers except letting men understand tell truth offend when every one may tell truth respect abates therefore wise prince ought hold third course choosing wise men his state giving only liberty speaking truth only those things which inquires none others ought question upon everything listen opinions afterwards form his own conclusions these councillors separately collectively ought carry himself such way each should know more freely shall speak more shall preferred outside these should listen no one pursue thing resolved steadfast his resolutions who otherwise either overthrown flatterers often changed varying opinions falls contempt wish subject adduce modern example fra luca man affairs maximilian 1 present emperor speaking his majesty said consulted no one yet never got his own way anything arose because his following practice opposite above emperor secretive man communicate his designs any one nor receive opinions carrying effect become revealed known once obstructed those men whom around being pliant diverted hence follows those things one day undoes next no one ever understands what wishes intends no one rely his resolutions 1 maximilian born 1459 died 1519 emperor holy roman empire married first mary daughter charles bold after death bianca sforza thus became involved italian politics prince therefore ought always take counsel only when wishes when others wish ought rather discourage every one offering advice unless asks however ought constant inquirer afterwards patient listener concerning things which inquired also learning any one any consideration told truth should let his anger felt if there some who think prince who conveys impression his wisdom through his own ability through good advisers around beyond doubt deceived because axiom which never fails prince who wise himself never take good advice unless chance yielded his affairs entirely one person who happens very prudent man case indeed may well governed long because such governor short time take away his state if prince who inexperienced should take counsel more one never get united counsels nor know how unite each counsellors think his own interests prince know how control see through found otherwise because men always prove untrue unless kept honest constraint therefore must inferred good counsels whencesoever come born wisdom prince wisdom prince good counsels why princes italy lost states previous suggestions carefully observed enable new prince appear well established render once more secure fixed state if been long seated there actions new prince more narrowly observed those hereditary one when seen able gain more men bind far tighter ancient blood because men attracted more present past when find present good enjoy seek no further also make utmost defence prince if fails other things thus double glory established new principality adorned strengthened good laws good arms good allies good example double disgrace who born prince shall lose his state want wisdom if those seigniors considered who lost states italy times such king naples duke milan others there found firstly one common defect regard arms causes which been discussed length next place some one seen either people hostile if people friendly known how secure nobles absence these defects states power enough keep army field cannot lost philip macedon father alexander great who conquered titus quintius much territory compared greatness romans greece who attacked yet being warlike man who knew how attract people secure nobles sustained war against his enemies many years if end lost dominion some cities nevertheless retained kingdom therefore let princes accuse fortune loss principalities after many years possession rather own sloth because quiet times never thought there change common defect man make any provision calm against tempest when afterwards bad times came thought flight defending themselves hoped people disgusted insolence conquerors recall course when others fail may good very bad neglected all other expedients since never wish fall because trusted able find someone later restore again either happen if security because deliverance no avail which depend upon yourself those only reliable certain durable depend yourself valour what fortune effect human affairs how withstand unknown how many men still opinion affairs world such wise governed fortune god men wisdom cannot direct no one even help because us believe necessary labour much affairs let chance govern opinion been more credited times because great changes affairs which been seen may still seen every day beyond all human conjecture sometimes pondering am some degree inclined opinion nevertheless extinguish free hold true fortune arbiter one half actions 1 still leaves us direct other half perhaps little less 1

which when flood overflows plains sweeping away trees buildings bearing away soil place place everything flies before all yield its violence without being able any way withstand yet though its nature such follow therefore men when weather becomes fair shall make provision both defences barriers such manner rising again waters may pass away canal force neither unrestrained nor dangerous happens fortune who shows power where valour prepared resist thither turns forces where knows barriers defences been raised constrain if consider italy which seat these changes which given impulse see open country without barriers without any defence if been defended proper valour germany spain france either invasion made great changes made come all consider enough say concerning resistance fortune general confining myself more particular say prince may seen happy day ruined morrow without having shown any change disposition character believe arises firstly causes already been discussed length namely prince who relies entirely fortune lost when changes believe also successful who directs his actions according spirit times whose actions accord times successful because men seen affairs lead end which every man before namely glory riches get there various methods one caution another haste one force another skill one patience another its opposite each one succeeds reaching goal different method one also see two cautious men one attain his end other fail similarly two men different observances equally successful one being cautious other impetuous all arises nothing else whether conform methods spirit times follows what said two men working differently bring same effect two working similarly one attains his object other changes estate also issue if one who governs himself caution patience times affairs converge such way his administration successful his fortune made if times affairs change ruined if change his course action man often found sufficiently circumspect know how accommodate himself change both because cannot deviate what nature inclines also because having always prospered acting one way cannot persuaded well leave therefore cautious man when time turn adventurous know how hence ruined changed his conduct times fortune changed pope julius second went work impetuously all his affairs found times circumstances conform well line action always met success consider his first enterprise against bologna messer giovanni bentivogli being still alive venetians agreeable nor king spain enterprise still discussion king france nevertheless personally entered upon expedition his accustomed boldness energy move which made spain venetians stand irresolute passive latter fear former desire recover kingdom naples other hand drew after king france because king having observed movement desiring make pope his friend humble venetians found impossible refuse therefore julius his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff simple human wisdom done if waited rome until get away his plans arranged everything fixed any other pontiff done never succeeded because king france made thousand excuses others raised thousand fears leave his

extraordinarily ways god been manifested beyond example sea divided cloud led way rock poured forth water rained manna everything contributed greatness ought rest god willing everything thus take away free share glory which belongs us wondered if none above named italians been able accomplish all expected illustrious house if many revolutions italy many campaigns always appeared if military virtue exhausted happened because old order things good none us known how find new one nothing honours man more establish new laws new ordinances when himself newly risen such things when well founded dignified make revered admired italy there wanting opportunities bring such use every form here there great valour limbs whilst fails head look attentively duels hand hand combats how superior italians strength dexterity subtlety when comes armies bear comparison springs entirely insufficiency leaders since those who capable obedient each one seems himself know there having never been any one distinguished above rest either valour fortune others yield hence long time during much fighting past twenty years whenever there been army wholly italian always given poor account itself first witness il taro afterwards allesandria capua genoa vaila bologna mestri 2 2 battles il taro 1495 alessandria 1499 capua 1501 genoa 1507 vaila 1509 bologna 1511 mestri 1513 if therefore illustrious house wishes follow these remarkable men who redeemed country necessary before all things true foundation every enterprise provided own forces because there no more faithful truer better soldiers although singly good altogether much better when find themselves commanded prince honoured maintained his expense therefore necessary prepared such arms defended against foreigners italian valour although swiss spanish infantry may considered very formidable nevertheless there defect both reason which third order only able oppose might relied upon overthrow spaniards cannot resist cavalry switzers afraid infantry whenever encounter close combat owing been may again seen spaniards unable resist french cavalry switzers overthrown spanish infantry although complete proof latter cannot shown nevertheless there some evidence battle ravenna when spanish infantry confronted german battalions who follow same tactics swiss when spaniards agility body aid shields got pikes germans stood danger able attack while germans stood helpless if cavalry dashed all been possible therefore knowing defects both these infantries invent new one which resist cavalry afraid infantry need create new order arms variation upon old these kind improvements which confer reputation power upon new prince opportunity therefore ought allowed pass letting italy last see liberator appear nor one express love which received all those provinces which suffered much these foreign scourings what thirst revenge what stubborn faith what devotion what tears what door closed who refuse obedience what envy hinder what italian refuse homage all us barbarous dominion stinks let therefore illustrious house take charge courage hope which all enterprises undertaken its standard native country may ennobled

having mastered tactics decided join battle first spoke few words encouragement his soldiers pointed certainty victory if obey his commands castruccio noticed how enemy placed all his best troops centre line battle his less reliable men wings army whereupon exactly opposite putting his most valiant men flanks while those whom strongly rely moved centre observing order battle drew his lines quickly came sight hostile army who usual come insolence defy commanded his centre squadrons march slowly whilst moved rapidly forward those wings thus when came contact enemy only wings two armies became engaged whilst center battalions remained action these two portions line battle separated each other long interval thus unable reach each other expedient more valiant part castruccio s men

anxiety hear its inception encouraged stefano bring his family saying thanked god having given opportunity showing his clemency liberality upon word stefano castruccio surrendered stefano immediately thrown prison put death meanwhile florentines recovered san miniato whereupon seemed advisable castruccio make peace appear sufficiently secure lucca leave approached florentines proposal truce which readily entertained weary war desirous getting rid expenses treaty concluded two years which both parties agreed keep conquests made castruccio thus released trouble turned his attention affairs lucca order should again subject perils which escaped various pretences reasons first wiped all those who ambition might aspire principality sparing one depriving country property those whom his hands life also stating found experience none trusted his further security raised fortress lucca stones towers those whom killed hunted state whilst castruccio made peace florentines strengthened his position lucca neglected no opportunity short open war increasing his importance elsewhere appeared if get possession pistoia one foot florence which his great desire therefore various ways made friends

forward pagolo way pisa went himself direct pistoia midnight both met outside city both admitted friends thus two leaders entered signal given castruccio one killed jacopo da gia other bastiano di possente both took prisoners killed partisans either faction without further opposition pistoia passed hands castruccio who having forced signoria leave palace compelled people yield obedience making many promises remitting old debts countryside flocked city see new prince all filled hope quickly settled influenced great measure his great valour time great disturbances arose rome owing dearness living which caused absence pontiff avignon german governor enrico much blamed what happened murders tumults following each other daily without his being able put end caused enrico much anxiety lest romans should call ruberto king naples who drive germans city bring back pope having no nearer friend whom apply help castruccio sent begging only give assistance also come person rome castruccio considered ought hesitate render emperor service because believed himself safe if any time emperor ceased hold rome leaving pagolo guinigi command lucca castruccio set rome six hundred horsemen where received enrico greatest distinction short time presence castruccio obtained such respect emperor without bloodshed violence good order restored chiefly reason castruccio having sent sea country round pisa large quantities corn thus removed source trouble when chastised some roman leaders admonished others voluntary obedience rendered enrico castruccio received many honours made roman senator dignity assumed greatest pomp castruccio being clothed brocaded toga which following words embroidered its front am what god wills whilst back what god desires shall during time florentines who much enraged castruccio should seized pistoia during truce considered how tempt city rebel which thought difficult his absence among exiled pistoians florence baldo cecchi jacopo baldini both men leading ready face danger these men kept communications friends pistoia aid florentines entered city night after driving some castruccio s officials partisans killing others restored city its freedom news greatly angered castruccio taking leave enrico pressed great haste pistoia when florentines heard his return knowing lose no time decided intercept forces val di nievole belief doing cut off his road pistoia assembling great army supporters guelph cause florentines entered pistoian territories other hand castruccio reached montecarlo his army having heard where florentines lay decided encounter plains pistoia nor await plains pescia far possibly attack boldly pass serravalle believed if succeeded design victory assured although informed florentines thirty thousand men whilst only twelve thousand although every confidence his own abilities valour his troops yet hesitated attack his enemy open lest should overwhelmed numbers serravalle castle between pescia pistoia situated hill which blocks val di nievole exact pass bowshot beyond pass itself places narrow steep whilst general ascends gently still narrow especially summit where waters divide twenty men side side hold lord serravalle manfred german who before castruccio became lord pistoia been allowed remain possession castle being common lucchese pistoians unclaimed either neither wishing displace manfred long kept his promise neutrality came obligations no one these reasons also because castle well fortified always been able maintain his position here castruccio determined fall upon his enemy here his few men advantage there no fear lest seeing large masses hostile force before became engaged should stand soon trouble florence arose castruccio saw immense advantage which possession castle give having intimate friendship resident castle managed matters four hundred his men admitted castle night before attack florentines castellan put death castruccio having prepared everything now encourage florentines persist desire carry seat war away pistoia val di nievole therefore move his army montecarlo thus florentines hurried until reached encampment serravalle intending cross hill following morning meantime castruccio seized castle night also moved his army montecarlo marching thence midnight dead silence reached foot serravalle thus florentines commenced ascent hill same time morning castruccio sent forward his infantry main road troop four hundred horsemen path left towards castle florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead army which following never expecting find castruccio possession hill nor aware his having seized castle thus happened florentine horsemen mounting hill completely taken surprise when discovered infantry castruccio close upon scarcely time pull visors case unready soldiers being attacked ready assailed such vigour difficulty hold own although some few got through when noise fighting reached florentine camp below filled confusion cavalry infantry became inextricably mixed captains unable get men either backward forward owing narrowness pass amid all tumult no one knew what ought done what done short time cavalry who engaged enemy s infantry scattered killed without having made any effective defence because unfortunate position although sheer desperation offered stout resistance retreat been impossible mountains both flanks whilst front enemies rear friends when castruccio saw his men unable strike decisive blow enemy put flight sent one thousand infantrymen round castle orders join four hundred horsemen previously dispatched there commanded whole force fall upon flank enemy these orders carried such fury florentines sustain attack gave way soon full retreat conquered more unfortunate position valour enemy those rear turned towards pistoia spread through plains each man seeking only his own safety defeat complete very sanguinary many captains taken prisoners among whom bandini dei rossi francesco brunelleschi giovanni della tosa all florentine noblemen many tuscans neapolitans who fought florentine side having been sent king ruberto assist guelphs immediately pistoians heard defeat drove friends guelphs surrendered castruccio content occupying prato all castles plains both sides arno marched his army plain peretola two miles florence here remained many days dividing spoils celebrating his victory feasts games holding horse races foot races men women also struck medals commemoration defeat florentines endeavoured corrupt some citizens florence who open city gates night conspiracy discovered participators taken beheaded among whom tommaso lupacci lambertuccio frescobaldi defeat caused florentines great anxiety despairing preserving liberty sent envoys king ruberto naples offering dominion city knowing what immense importance maintenance guelph cause accepted agreed florentines receive yearly tribute two hundred thousand florins sent his son carlo florence four thousand horsemen shortly after florentines relieved some degree pressure castruccio s army owing his being compelled leave his positions before florence march pisa order suppress conspiracy been raised against benedetto lanfranchi one first men pisa who endure his fatherland should dominion lucchese formed conspiracy intending seize citadel kill partisans castruccio drive garrison however conspiracy paucity numbers essential secrecy its execution few sufficient seeking more adherents his conspiracy lanfranchi encountered person who revealed design castruccio betrayal cannot passed without severe reproach bonifacio cerchi giovanni guidi two florentine exiles who suffering banishment pisa thereupon castruccio seized benedetto put death beheaded many other noble citizens drove families exile now appeared castruccio both pisa pistoia thoroughly disaffected employed much thought energy upon securing his position there gave florentines opportunity reorganize army await coming carlo son king naples when carlo arrived decided lose no more time assembled great army more thirty thousand infantry ten thousand cavalry having called aid every guelph there italy consulted whether should attack pistoia pisa first decided better march latter course owing recent conspiracy more likely succeed more advantage because believed surrender pistoia follow acquisition pisa early part may 1328 florentines put motion army quickly occupied lastra signa montelupo empoli passing thence san miniato when castruccio heard enormous army which florentines sending against no degree alarmed believing time now arrived when fortune deliver empire tuscany his hands no reason think his enemy make better fight better prospects success pisa serravalle assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers four thousand horsemen army went fucecchio whilst sent pagolo guinigi pisa five thousand infantry fucecchio stronger position any other town pisan district owing its situation between rivers arno gusciana its slight elevation above surrounding plain moreover enemy hinder its being victualled unless divided forces nor approach either direction lucca pisa nor get through pisa attack castruccio s forces except disadvantage one case find themselves placed between his two armies one his own command other pagolo other case cross arno get close quarters enemy undertaking great hazard order tempt florentines take latter course castruccio withdrew his men banks river placed walls fucecchio leaving wide expanse land between river florentines having occupied san miniato held council war decide whether should attack pisa army castruccio having weighed difficulties both courses decided upon latter river arno time low enough fordable yet water reached shoulders infantrymen saddles horsemen morning 10 june 1328 florentines commenced battle ordering forward number cavalry ten thousand infantry castruccio whose plan action fixed who well knew what once attacked florentines five thousand infantry three thousand horsemen allowing issue river before charged also sent one thousand light infantry river bank same number arno infantry florentines much impeded arms water able mount banks river whilst cavalry made passage river more difficult others reason few who crossed having broken bed river being deep mud many horses rolled riders many stuck fast move when florentine captains saw difficulties men meeting withdrew moved higher river hoping find river bed less treacherous banks more adapted landing these men met bank forces which castruccio already sent forward who being light armed bucklers javelins hands let fly tremendous shouts faces bodies cavalry horses alarmed noise wounds move forward trampled each other great confusion fight between men castruccio those enemy who succeeded crossing sharp terrible both sides fought utmost desperation neither yield soldiers castruccio fought drive others back river whilst florentines strove get footing land order make room others pressing forward who if get water able fight obstinate conflict urged captains castruccio shouted his men these same enemies whom before conquered serravalle whilst florentines reproached each other many should overcome few length castruccio seeing how long battle lasted both his men enemy utterly exhausted both sides many killed wounded pushed forward another body infantry take position rear those who fighting commanded these latter open ranks if intended retreat one part turn right another left cleared space which florentines once took advantage thus gained possession portion battlefield when these tired soldiers found themselves close quarters castruccio s reserves stand against once fell back river cavalry either side yet gained any decisive advantage other because castruccio knowing his inferiority arm

second letter entertained hope wickham s meaning marry no one jane thought flatter herself such expectation surprise least all feelings development while contents first letter remained mind all surprise all astonishment wickham should marry girl whom impossible marry money how lydia ever attached appeared incomprehensible now all too natural such attachment might sufficient charms though suppose lydia deliberately engaging elopement without intention marriage no difficulty believing neither virtue nor understanding preserve falling easy prey never perceived while regiment

gardiner there no absolute proof gone scotland oh removing chaise hackney coach such presumption besides no traces found barnet road well supposing london may there though purpose concealment no more exceptionable purpose likely money should very abundant either side might strike more economically though less expeditiously married london scotland why all secrecy why any fear detection why must marriage private oh no no likely his most particular friend see jane s account persuaded his never intending marry wickham never marry woman without some money cannot afford what claims lydia what attractions beyond youth health good humour make sake forego every chance benefiting himself marrying well what restraint apprehensions disgrace corps might throw dishonourable elopement am able judge know nothing effects such step might produce other objection am afraid hardly hold good lydia no brothers step forward might imagine father s behaviour his indolence little attention ever seemed give
